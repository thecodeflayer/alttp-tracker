# alttp-tracker
A mobile app for tracking ALTTP randomizer runs. You can track items collected, dungeon items and bosses and view available locations on the Light World and Dark World maps.

The tracker currently only supports standard, no glitch, runs and is geared towards new players who are learning.

In the future, based on interest, I may add support for other modes such as inverted, keysanity and more.

## Supported Platforms
Currently I'm only building APKs for Android. I still need to figure out how to build for iOS.

## Installation
Coming soon!
