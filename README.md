# alttp-tracker
A mobile app for tracking ALTTP randomizer runs. You can track items collected, dungeon items and bosses and view available locations on the Light World and Dark World maps.

The tracker currently only supports standard, no glitch runs and is geared towards new players who are learning.

In the future, based on interest, I may add support for other modes such as inverted, keysanity and more.

## Supported Platforms
Currently I'm only building APKs for Android. I still need to figure out how to build for iOS.

## Found a bug? Want a feature?
Please file an [issue](https://github.com/thecodeflayer/alttp-tracker/issues)!

First take a look at existing issues and make sure that it hasn't been filed before. Include descriptive information about the issue and screenshots if possible. Also include the version of the app that you're using.

I have not fully vetted the logic for all locations. I am looking for help in this area, especially for late game locations. Expect some issues here until I can get more feedback from the community. (I can only do so many runs myself)

## Installation
In order to install on Android you will have to "side-load" the APK from Github. On most modern Android platforms you can follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the latest release page on the Android device you want to install the app on. Current release is [0.9.3](https://github.com/thecodeflayer/alttp-tracker/releases/tag/0.9.3)
2. Under the Assets section, click on the APK file listed on the release page.
3. You will typically receive a warning about APK files harming your device. You will need to confirm download.
4. Once downloaded, click on the downloaded APK file.
5. You will typically receive a warning about installing apps from unknown providers or locations. Follow the on-screen instructions and allow installation.
6. After install, it's recommended to turn off the ability to load applications from unknown locations.
7. Enjoy tracking your rando runs!

## Why are you not on the Play Store?
The short version is "I'm trying."

The Play Store has very strict policies regarding popular IPs. Navigating this has proven to be a challenge. I will continue to pursue publication on the play store. Meanwhile, I'm hosting here for immidiate access. I'll continue distributing from Github as the update process for the Play Store is also slow and will always be behind what I can distribute here.
