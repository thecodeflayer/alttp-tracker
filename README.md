# alttp-tracker
A mobile app for tracking ALTTP randomizer runs. You can track items collected, dungeon items and bosses and view available locations on the Light World and Dark World maps.

The tracker currently supports both standard and inverted modes and is geared towards new players who are learning.
A number of game goals are also supported such as Defeat Ganon, Triforce Hunt and Pedestal Goal to name a few.

## Supported Platforms
Currently, I'm only building APKs for Android. I still need to figure out how to build for iOS.
