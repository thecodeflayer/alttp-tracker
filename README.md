# alttp-tracker
A mobile app for tracking ALTTP randomizer runs. You can track items collected, dungeon items and bosses and view available locations on the Light World and Dark World maps.

The tracker currently only supports standard, no glitch, runs and is geared towards new players who are learning.

In the future, based on interest, I may add support for other modes such as inverted, keysanity and more.

## Supported Platforms
Currently I'm only building APKs for Android. I still need to figure out how to build for iOS.

## Found a bug? Want a feature?
Please file an issue!

I have not fully vetted the logic for all locations. I am looking for help in this area, especially for late game locations. Expect some issues here until I can get more feedback from the community. (I can only do so many runs myself)

## Installation
In order to install on Android you will have to "side-load" the APK from Github. On most modern Android platforms you can follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the latest release page on the Android device you want to install the app on. Current release is [0.8.8](https://github.com/thecodeflayer/alttp-tracker/releases/tag/0.8.8)
2. Click on the APK file listed on the release page.
3. You should be prompted to give permission to install apps from that source.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and allow installation from Github.
5. Enjoy tracking your rando runs!
